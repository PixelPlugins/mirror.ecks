# The EPM Mirror
This repository is the mirror for EPM, the apt-get-style package manager for windows.

## Download EPM
Just click this...

[![EPM Download](https://github.com/PixelPlugins/mirror.ecks/blob/master/EPM.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/PixelPlugins/mirror.ecks/blob/master/EPM.exe?raw=true)
### IMPORTANT: EPM needs Jint, so be sure to click [here](https://github.com/PixelPlugins/mirror.ecks/blob/master/Jint.dll?raw=true) to download Jint.dll and put it in the same folder as EPM.exe!

## Usage
To use EPM, you must interface it with the command line. (However, a GUI is comming out soon). Open the folder that has EPM.exe and Jint.dll in it, and then hold shift and right-click in the white space to the side.(So your mouse isn't touching a file.) Then click "open command window/powershell here". Now you can use EPM commands.

Installing a package is easy: EPM &ltpackage name&gt

Every EPM package is stored on this repo. To do a quick test, try EPM example

When you install a package, it goes in C:\Ecks\Packages. After installing the example package, look in that folder and you will see example.txt.

5. Wait for a response, either saying your package was uploaded or that it failed
6. Test your package. Do EPM &ltyour package name&gt

### If it is multiple files:
